    <p>In a game design course, our team was given the objective of creating a game that used a non-linear narrative. The game had to include multiple levels and a gradual rise in difficulty, puzzle solving, and challenge. </p>

    <p>We decided to create a 2D top-down horror game that would have the player face a dilemma of having to find their daughter in an abandoned hospital while also having to find out the mystery behind a zombie apocolypse.</p>

        <p>I am a university student based in Vancouver, BC currently studying game design and programming at Simon Fraser University. Over 4 years of studying game mechanics and level design, I’ve gone through the process of developing several games that span across different genres; RPG, 3D Puzzle Platformer and 2D Action Platformer. With this experience, I have developed a multi perspective approach to game design.
         I strive to enable players with discovery, choice, and accomplishment. My experience of creating levels and environments from prototype to implementation has taught me to convey new ideas to players in ways that free players to credit themselves for their successes and failures.

            <p>Learning how to develop a game within a semester, and actually executing it was a challenging but enriching endeavour. In general, a much greater effort was required than what we expected, so we had to de-prioritize some functionalities we initially planned. For example, procedurally generated tile maps, game AI, and level persistence took a while to get done.
              Level design required a lot of thought and required a lengthy process in order to build and flesh out a proper level that included puzzles and platforming and places for enemies and loot, especially as a relatively open world for the player to explore. Pacing and rhythm was a challenge as well, since the player might not be playing in any particular order. Art was challenging as well, since our team lacked expertise in creating a artful and cohesive expression of our game. We believe that there is still much to be done in order to make the game more enjoyable and flow better.</p>
