    <h2 class ="smallHeader">TASK</h2>
    <p>In a game design course, our team was given the objective of creating a game that used a non-linear narrative. The game had to include multiple levels and a gradual rise in difficulty, puzzle solving, and challenge. </p>

  <div class ="column">
    <h2 class ="smallHeader">RESPONSE</h2>
    <p>We decided to create a 2D top-down horror game that would have the player face a dilemma of having to find their daughter in an abandoned hospital while also having to find out the mystery behind a zombie apocolypse.</p>

        <p>I am a university student based in Vancouver, BC currently studying game design and programming at Simon Fraser University. Over 4 years of studying game mechanics and level design, I’ve gone through the process of developing several games that span across different genres; RPG, 3D Puzzle Platformer and 2D Action Platformer. With this experience, I have developed a multi perspective approach to game design.
         I strive to enable players with discovery, choice, and accomplishment. My experience of creating levels and environments from prototype to implementation has taught me to convey new ideas to players in ways that free players to credit themselves for their successes and failures.

            <p>Reflecting upon this project, some things we learned in terms of design, story, and narrative, is that everything
has to flow together. The characters need to be thought out well, and the story needs to void of all plotholes.
Anything that makes the player question the story in terms of narrative and find plotholes, means we are not
doing our job correctly. If given the time to improve our game, some things we would do are to add in more
branching paths, and possibly add in more items, and even possibly an enemy or two to give the player
action. Other than that, we are satisfied with what we have created.
